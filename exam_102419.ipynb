    "\n",
    "Answer: Should work but isn't really a linear regrssion anymore\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is it possible to design a linear regression algoritm using a neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: True\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Which of the following evaluation metrics can be used to evaluate a model while modeling a continuous output \n",
    "\n",
    "a AUC ROC\n",
    "b. accuracy\n",
    "c. log loss\n",
    "d. mean square error\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Which of the following statements is true about outliers in linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "a linear regression is sensitiv to outliers \n",

    "\n",
    "Answer a\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Suppose you plotted a scatter plot between the residuals and predicted values in linear regression and you found there is a relationship between them what does that mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "a since there is a relationshiop model is not good\n",
    "b since there is a relationship model is good\n",
    "c can't say\n",
    "d. none of those\n",

    "9. Suppose we have N independent variables( x1, x2, x3, xn) and dependent variable is y\n",
    "imagine we are applying linear regression by fitting the best fit line using least square error on this data. We found that correlation. coefficient for one of this variable say x1 with y is .95. Which of the following is true for x1\n",
    "\n",
    "a relation between x and y is weak\n",
    "b relation between x and y is strong\n",
    "c relation between x and y is neutral\n",
    "d cannot judge the relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer b because a correlation coefficient is measured between - 1 and + 1 whereas a coefficent of + .95 equals almost perfect positiv correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Suppose you have a dataset D1 and you design a linear regression model of degree 3 polynomial and we found that the training and testing error is zero or in other terms it perfectly fits the data. What will happen when we fit a degree 4 polynomial in linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "a high chances that degree 4 polynomial will overfit the data\n",
    "b high chances that degree 4 polynomial will underfit the data\n",
